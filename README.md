   - **CLOUDINARY URL**: Signup/Login to Cloudinary. Navigate to the [cloudinary console](https://console.cloudinary.com/) and get your cloudinary URL secret. It should look like this `cloudinary://<your_api_key>:<your_api_secret>@djagytapi`

   - **YOUTUBE DEVELOPER KEY**: Retrieve your youtube developer key. You can check this [post](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key) on how to get it.

   - **TESSDATA PREFIX**: This is the location of where tesseract is installed on your machine. Install [tessract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for your os and set the location to `/usr/local/share/tessdata` for linux or `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata` for windows. If yours is configured to a different file location. Set it to where the **tessdata** location is on your machine.

   - **FAST API BASE URL**: Set this to `http://0.0.0.0:8000` or `http://localhost:8000` to connect the fast api server to the go code.

   - **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=9000 // or some other port
   MY_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   GROK_API_KEY=YOUR_GROK_API_KEY_HERE
   GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY_HERE
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN_HERE
   CLOUDINARY_URL=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_URL_HERE
   YOUTUBE_DEVELOPER_KEY=YOUR_YOUTUBE_DEVELOPER_KEY_HERE
   TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/local/share/tessdata //or C:\Program  Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata for windows
   FAST_API_BASE_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

3. **Build and run the Application**:
   First install all the python dependencies by running

   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade -r ./python/requirements.txt
